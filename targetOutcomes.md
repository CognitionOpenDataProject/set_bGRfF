For this article please focus on the findings reported for **Experiment 1 in Section 3.2 Rubber hand illusion - questionnaire**. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures.

> Data violated the assumptions for normality (Shapiro-Wilks, p < 0.05). Wilcoxon rank tests are reported. As we implemented a new procedure to induce the RHI, using a LED on the rubber hand and a mechanical tapper on the participantsâ€™ hand, we firstly tested whether such induction procedure was effective in producing a reliable illusion. To this aim we tested whether mean rating to illusion statements were significantly different from the "neither agree/disagree" response (i.e. central point in the Likert scale). Illusion ratings after synchronous stimulation (Median(SD): 1.5(1.18)) was significantly higher than the central point (Wilcoxon test: p < 0.001). Hence, we can safely infer that we induced the RHI. Importantly, when comparing the synchronous and the asynchronous conditions (i.e. 25% rate of perceive synchrony) we found that participants experienced a significantly stronger RHI following the synchronous (median(SD) = 1.5(1.18)) compared to the asynchronous condition (median(SD) = 0.8(1.35); z(35) = 2.38; p = 0.017.
